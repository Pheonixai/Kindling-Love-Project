**KINDLING - A SPACE TO BE SEEN**
---

**Project Overview**

In a digital landscape often dominated by high-decibel social interaction and performance metrics, Kindling serves as a sanctuary for the quiet. I designed this platform to facilitate anonymous, peaceful connection where the value is placed on being heard rather than being "liked." It is a dedicated space for simple human acknowledgement, allowing users to feel a little less alone in their thoughts.

**Project Name: Kindling**

**Problem Statement:** Addressing the digital invisibility and social noise that often alienates introverted individuals or those seeking quiet support.

**Target Audience:** Introverts, individuals seeking anonymous emotional refuge, and those desiring brief, authentic human connections.

**Core Features:**

Anonymous "Seed" Posting: Direct, non-performative thought sharing with zero profile history.

Resonance System: A metric-free acknowledgement mechanism that values quality of connection over quantity.

Visual Love Garden: A real-time data visualization of community empathy, where collective resonance "grows" the interface.

Spark Channels: Managed, time-limited (10-minute) chat connections triggered only by mutual resonance to prevent harassment.

Colour Palette: I implemented the "Pink Sorbet" theme, utilizing soft, warm hex codes (#F4978E, #F8AD9D) to evoke a sense of affection and safety without overstimulating the user.

Typography: The design utilizes Inter Bold for structural clarity, contrasted with soft, italicized serifs to highlight emotional keywords and pull-quotes.

Layout Design: I employed a "Soft Bento" modular grid alongside Glassmorphic navigation to create an interface that feels organized yet organic, inspired by modern wellness aesthetics found on Dribbble.
